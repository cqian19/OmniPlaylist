"This video contains content from ---------, who has blocked it on copyright grounds."  
And there goes another of your favorite songs on YouTube. Maybe now you'll actually have to pay for it. But perhaps you found it on another site, and you don't want the hassle of constantly switching between playlists on different websites. Then this app is for you.

OmniPlaylist allows you to create, manage, and play content from different websites all from one place. Importing videos/playlists is as easy as entering a URL. A single playlist can contain videos, songs, and even livestreams from supported websites. Playlists save automatically.
